Structured logs are for machines. `lume` is for humans. While machines consume and process structured logs efficiently, humans prefer aesthetics, clarity, and colors. `lume` takes structured JSON logs and transforms them into vibrant, human-readable logs, perfect for local development.

With `lume`, each log line gets transformed:

- **Colorful Levels**: Depending on the log level (`INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `TRACE`), `lume` colorizes the log prefix for instant recognition.
  - `[ INFO ]` is in green
  - `[ ERROR ]` is in red
  - `[ WARN ]` is in yellow
  - `[ TRACE ]` is in blue

- **Timestamps**: Human-friendly timestamps to quickly grasp when the event occurred.

- **Structured Data**: `lume` simplifies complex JSON structures, presenting additional data in a key-value format, easy to read and understand.

## Installation

With [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```fish
fisher install https://github.com/srizzling/lume
```

## Usage

```fish
echo '{"lvl": "INFO", "msg": "Hello World", "timestamp": "2023-08-19T12:00:00Z"}' | lume
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LUME_LINE_COUNT`    | `10`    | Maximum number of lines to accumulate before issuing a warning |

## Caveats

1. **Buffering**: Some shells or pipelines buffer the output, which might introduce a delay in the logs being displayed.
2. **Incomplete JSON**: `lume` accumulates lines until it gets a valid JSON object. If the log stream contains invalid JSON or logs that are not JSON at all, `lume` will issue a warning after a certain number of lines (configurable).
3. **Performance**: For very high-frequency log streams, there might be some lag due to the overhead of processing each log individually.

**Note**: While `lume` is exceptional for human-readable logs during local development, it's not designed for large quantities of logs. It does not scale and should not be used for processing vast log data.
